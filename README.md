# odin-recipes
My First Odin Project

A project to test HTML project that had been learned along ODIN Foundation Curriculum.
Among skills that had been learned:
-Create HTML file
-Set up html boilerplate
-Writing elements(meta,title,heading from 1 to 6,paragraph,ordered and unordered  list, strong,emphasis)
-Create Links and images elements.
 
 About Recipe:
 it is going to be about internet meme recipes.
 -What is meme
 -Type of meme
 -How to make a good meme

 For the time being(31 August 2022), the html file will be simple in format,appearance and interaction. Contains only html element without CSS an JS as the Curriculum does not reach there yet.
