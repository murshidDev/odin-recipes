    <p>Roti canai (pronunciation: /tʃanaɪ/) or roti prata, also known as roti chenai and roti cane (/tʃane/), 
        is an Indian flatbread dish found in several countries in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, 
        Singapore, Thailand, and Brunei. It is usually served with dal or other types of curry, but can also be 
        cooked in a range of sweet or savoury variations made with a variety of ingredients such as meat, eggs, or cheese.

        Introduced around the 19th century, roti canai has become a popular breakfast and snack dish especially in 
        the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia and Singapore, and is one of the most famous examples of South Indian
         cuisine into the region.[1][9] It is said that the dish was brought by Indians during the era of British Malaya
          and the Straits Settlements. They’re also colloquially known as "Mamak", and is served in street Mamak stalls 
          located in both rural and urban Malaysia as well as within hawker centres in Singapore. However, 
          previously the dish had also been introduced in the 17th century in Aceh and North Sumatra by Indian traders 
          under the name Roti Cane.[citation needed] The dish can be found in Indonesia, especially in Sumatra, where the 
          Indian Indonesian community is more prominent compared to the rest of the country.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roti_canai">[1]</a></p>
    
    <h2>How To Make Roti Canai<a href="https://www.lokataste.com/roti-canai-recipe/">[2]</a></h2>


    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>520g bread flour</li>
            <li>1 egg(room temperature)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp condensated milk</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <h4>Roti Canai Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, salt, sugar and 1/4 cup of the ghee in the bowl of a stand mixer. Run on low speed with a dough hook until mixture clumps.</li>
            <li>Add egg, milk and water. Continue to mix until a smooth elastic dough is formed. Knead into a smooth, soft, elastic dough, about 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be a bit sticky, but not wet.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough out and cut into eight equal pieces, about 4 oz. each (113 g). Form into smooth balls.</li>
            <li>Coat each ball with one teaspoon of ghee, slathering them well. Arrange in a single layer on a plate, cover with a damn cloth and allow them to rest at room temperature for at least 6 hours. (The dough can be made a day ahead and kept in the refrigerator.)</li>

        </ol>
        
        <h4>Prepare Workspace</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>If the dough was prepared the day ahead, let come to a warm room temperature. So if your kitchen is cold, place the dough in
                warm area, or you can even microwave it for 10 second
                intervals. Warm dough is more elastic and easier to work
                with.</li>
            <li>Clean a 2-inch × 2-inch surface, and coat it with a 12-inch circle (30 cm) of ghee (about 2 tablespoons). Coat hands liberally with ghee.</li>
            <li>Stretch the dough into a sheet; put 1 teaspoon of ghee in center of the buttered work area.</li>
            <li>Arrange one dough ball in the center. Press with your buttered palm to flatten dough into a 6-inch disc, less than 1/4 inch thick, slightly thinner around edges.</li>
            <li>Pull and stretch it from the center outwards. Make sure most of dough is paper thin by moving around dough perimeter with your fingertips and thumbs, lifting thicker edges, pulling outwards to thin, and gently pressing against table to adhere.</li>
            <li>Systematically, slowly, work your way around the
                perimeter of dough circle, pulling outwards to thin the
                dough. For the first few rounds, pull 3 to 4 inches (about
                8 to 10 cm) each time, making it thinner and thinner. As it
                gets thinner, it will be obvious where the thicker parts of
                the dough are. Focus on those areas. Keep going until you
                achieve a paper thin sheet. It should reach about 2 feet in diameter. Use the tips of your fingers to smooth the thicker part paper thin.</li>
            <li>Using two hands, fold top quarter of dough over itself, almost reaching middle of sheet. Fold top edge over again to meet the top edge. Then repeat with other sides to create a square multi-layered square of dough about 6 to 8 inches (about 16 to 20 cm). Each time you fold, try to capture some air in-between layers.</li>
          
        </ol>
        
        
        <h4>Cook The Bread</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a griddle or large saute pan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Firmly flatten and spread one disc of dough until it is 7 inches to 8 inches in diameter or (18 to 20 cm). The dough will be elastic, and may pull back a little.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the griddle with a little ghee. Add one bread to the pan, and cook slowly, turning once, 3 to 4 minutes per side, rotating occasionally to ensure even browning. Cook until each side is deep golden brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer the breads to a work surface, and then use a clapping motion (careful it will be hot), slapping the bread together between your hands to separate the layers.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining roti, cooking as many as will fit in the pan at one time. Serve immediately with curry sauce or sugar.</li>

        </ol>
