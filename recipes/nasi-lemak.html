        <h1>Nasi Lemak</h1>
        <img src="https://cdn.tasteatlas.com/Images/Dishes/64314ce524544b5991a780896cf84d3f.jpg?mw=1300">
        <p>Nasi lemak is a dish originating in Malay cuisine that consists of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf.
             It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered the national dish.
              It is also the native dish in neighbouring areas with significant Malay populations such as Singapore,
             Brunei, and Southern Thailand. In Indonesia it can be found in several parts of Sumatra, especially the Malay regions of Riau,
              Riau Islands and Medan.[11] Nasi lemak can also be found in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, prepared by Filipino Moros,
               as well as Australia's external territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.
                It is considered an essential dish for a typical Malay-style breakfast. 
                Nasi lemak is featured as a national dish in most of the country’s tourism brochures and promotional materials. 

            It is not to be confused with nasi dagang, sold in the Malaysian east coast states of Terengganu and Kelantan 
            (and its kindred region in Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat in Thailand and Natuna in Indonesia), although both dishes are often served for breakfast. 
            However, because nasi lemak can be served in a variety of ways, it is often eaten throughout the day.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasi_lemak">[1]</a>

           <h2>Directions:</h2>
        
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together coconut milk, water, ground ginger, ginger root, salt, bay leaf, and rice. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until done.

        </p>
        
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. 
            Bring water to a boil, and immediately remove from heat. 
            Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. 
            Remove eggs from hot water, cool, peel and slice in half.
             Slice cucumber.</p>
        
         <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or wok, heat 1 cup vegetable
             oil over medium-high heat.
             Stir in peanuts and cook briefly, until lightly browned. 
             Remove peanuts with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels to 
             soak up excess grease. Return skillet to stove. Stir in the
              contents of one package anchovies; cook briefly, turning,
               until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper 
               towels.
             Discard oil. Wipe out skillet.</p>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet. 
            Stir in the onion, garlic, and shallots; 
            cook until fragrant, about 1 or 2 minutes.
             Mix in the chile paste, and cook for 10 minutes,
              stirring occasionally. If the chile paste is 
              too dry, add a small amount of water. Stir in 
              remaining anchovies; cook for 5 minutes. Stir 
              in salt, sugar, and tamarind juice; simmer until
               sauce is thick, about 5 minutes.</p>
        
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Serve the onion and garlic sauce over the warm rice,
             and top with peanuts, fried anchovies, cucumbers,
              and eggs.</p>
